		<section class="abstract">
			<p>We use a cellular automaton model to simulate 3 types of intersections - (1) simple roundabout, (2) roundabout with quick right turn and (3) basic traffic lights.</p>
			<p>We analyze the traffic flow dynamics of each intersections, finding bounds of their optimal use cases. We compare these traffic control systems in terms of their efficiency at usual traffic flow metrics such as <em>average time spent in the intersection</em> and <em>intersection throughput</em>.</p>
			<p>The model consists of 2 perpendicular roads each with 2 lanes (totaling 4 directions), intersection control system and homogenous agents representing cars.</p>
			<p>For this task we used NetLogo simulation software. Source code of our simulation is attached in the document.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p>During the past few decades we have seen a wide adoption of alternative traffic control schemes, especially roundabouts.</p>
				<p>Traffic managements is becoming extremely complex due to overloaded communications and predicting the traffic flow cannot be considered reliable.</p>
				<p>A need for flexibility has lead to innovative traffic control mechanisms.</p>
				<p>With many possibilities in organization of vehicular traffic, it is important to understand basic principles of the intersections.</p>
				<p>Despite the promising results of roundabout scheme, we still encounter mostly traffic lights, which are typical for dense urban areas.
				<p>We set out to explore a very limited amount of these two traffic control mechanisms in simplified conditions.</p>
				<p>Our focus is solely on efficieny, not considering additional problems such as environmental impact or general safety.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Traffic simulation can become highly complex, considering many factors such as acceleration, yield-of-way-rules and speed regulation.</p>
				<p>Due to the dynamic nature of our nature, we need to simulate traffic flow.</p>
				<p>A general objective of keeping the traffic flow on a highest level possible might be misleading.</p>
				<p>Despite the symmetric nature of our targeted intersections, traffic flow from one direction can be effectively throttled by another road.</p>
				<p>We try to understand the traffic flow limits considering the 4 directions of the intersection connects.</p>
