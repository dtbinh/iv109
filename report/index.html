			<p>We use a cellular automaton model to simulate 3 types of intersections - (1) simple roundabout, (2) roundabout with quick right turn and (3) basic traffic lights.</p>
			<p>We analyze traffic flow dynamics of each intersection, finding their optimal use cases. We compare these traffic control systems in terms of their efficiency at usual traffic flow metrics such as <em>average time spent in the intersection</em>.</p>
			<p>The model consists of 2 perpendicular roads each with 2 lanes (totaling 4 directions), intersection control system and cars as homogenous agents.</p>
			<p>For this task we use NetLogo simulation software.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="layout two-columns">
			<p>During the past few decades we have seen a wide adoption of alternative traffic control schemes, especially roundabouts.</p>
			<p>Traffic management is becoming extremely complex due to overloaded communications and predicting the traffic flow cannot be considered reliable.</p>
			<p>A need for flexibility has lead to innovative traffic control mechanisms.</p>
			<p>With many possibilities in organization of vehicular traffic, it is important to understand basic principles of the intersections.</p>
			<p>Despite the promising results of roundabout scheme, we still encounter mostly traffic lights, which are typical for dense urban areas.
			<p>We set out to explore a very limited amount of these two traffic control mechanisms in simplified conditions.</p>
			<p>Our focus is solely on efficieny, not considering additional problems such as environmental impact or general safety.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="layout two-columns">
			<p>Traffic simulation can become highly complex, considering many factors such as acceleration, yield-right-of-way-rules and speed regulation.</p>
			<p>A general objective of keeping the traffic flow on a highest level possible might be misleading.</p>
			<p>Despite the symmetric nature of our targeted intersections, traffic flow from one direction can be effectively throttled by another road.</p>
			<p>Our objective is to analyze several traffic situations of various traffic loads and determine the best control scheme under these conditions.</p>
			<p>We try to understand the traffic flow limits for each of these situations.</p>

			<h2>Construction of the Model</h2>

		</div>

		<div class="layout">

			<p>The simulated world consists of a grid of 120x120 patches. Travelling distance from a patch to all is neighbours represents 1 meter in the real world (see fig. 1).</p>
			<aside class="aside-left patches-distance">
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/patches.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Distance between patches $|AB| = |AC| = |AD| = 1 m$</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</aside>
			<p>As a base for our computations, we consider the smallest discrete time interval (aka <em>tick</em>) to be <strong>1 second</strong> in the real world.</p>
			<p>Cars are homogenous agents, represented using NetLogo's <em>turtles</em>. Each turtle moves n patches over 1 second, where n is it's current speed.</p>
			<p>Turtles are allowed to move only on <em>road</em> patches. Each <em>road</em> patch has a static variable <em>priority</em> used for determining the right-of-way rules.</p>
			<p>Turtles are created on one of 4 <em>spawn</em> patches, each representing the one of the 4 possible inbound directions. Spawn patches can be considered as the input of the <em>outside world</em>.</p>
			<p>Spawns are operated independently, using probabilistic function for creating new turtles. In one tick, at the most only 1 turtle is created on 1 spawn.</p>
			<p>Probabilistic distribution ensures the random (but not uniform) space and time gaps between 2 turtles coming from the same direction.</p>
		
		</div>
	</section>

	
	<section class="movement">
		<div class="layout">

			<h2>Movement of the Turtles</h2>

			<p>Upon the creation of the turtle, each one is assigned it's final direction using a uniform probabilistic function. Since some of our modeled control schemes do not allow U-turn (i.e. 180° change in car's direction), we disallow U-turns from all of our model situations.</p>
			<p>Therefore our model assumes distribution of 33/33/33 % for left/straight/right turns.</p>
			<p>The concept of turtle movement is based on a modified version of <em>Nagel–Schreckenberg model</em><sup>1,2</sup>. In this model we are not considering the random decrease of speed of turtles.</p>
			<p>The outline of our movement model of the turtle can be represented in these steps, which occur on every tick $i$:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Acceleration:</strong> Velocity $v_{t}$ of each turtle $t$ is increased by the acceleration $a = 1$. This represents the acceleration of $1 m/s^2$ in the real world. This is close to the real-world $1.4 m/s^2$ acceleration observed in our road tests.</p>
					<p>$v_{t}^{(i+1/2)} = v_{t}^{(i)} + a$</p>
					<p>Using a constant acceleration $a$, our model assumes uniform acceleration of a car accross the whole speed range.</p>
				</li>	
				<li>
					<p><strong>Slowdown and allocation:</strong> The velocity of the turtle is limited by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>maximal speed $vmax_r$ of road $r$</li>
						<li>distance $d$ to the nearest obstacle (another turtle, field allocated by another turtle or stopping traffic light)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>$v_{t}^{(i+1)} = min\{v_{t}^{(i+1/2)}, vmax_r, d\}$</p>
					<aside class="aside-right patch-priorities">
						<figure>
							<img src="assets/images/priorities.png" alt="">
							<figcaption>Black patches in our simulation represent high-priority road. Grey patches represent low-priority road.</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</aside>
					<p>Maximum speed of the road is fixed $14 m/s$, representing $\sim 50\ km/h$ in the real world.</p>
					<p>Due to the two-dimensional space (instead of just one-dimensional found in NS model) we need to introduce a process of patch allocation.</p>
					<p>The allocation process may introduce nondeterministic behaviour in two-dimensional space. To achieve a deterministic behavior, we need to execute the slowdown and allocation in an ordered manner. Turtles in this process are partially ordered using the priority of their current patch, which can be either $1$ (executed later) or $2$ (executed sooner).</p>
					<p>Each turtle allocates fields on its own path.</p>
					<p>In the allocation process, turtle deterministically chooses the next patch accroding to its final direction. Patch in this direction is preferred over other patches which are preferred over patch with the opposite direction.</p>
					<p>Each turtle allocates at most $v_t^{(i+1)} \times l$ patches.</p>
					<p>Allocation factor $l$ ensures that turtle yields the right of way if the second turtle is less than $l$ seconds away. In our model we use constant allocation factor $l = 3$.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Speed variation:</strong> This step in the original NS model represents the random slowdown of certain turtles. This event is not considered in our model.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Each turtle is moved $v_t^{(i+1)}$ patches along its allocated path.</p>
				</li>

			<h2>Simulated control schemes</h2>
			
			<div class="one-third">
				<h3>Classic roundabout</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/roundabout.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Classic roundabout</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The first traffic control mechanism analyzed in our model is <em>Classic roundabout</em>.</p>
				<p>We compare roundabouts of various sizes, described by radius $r$ and lane gap $g = r/6$ illustrated in <em>figure 2</em>.</p>
				<p>In our simulations, we use fixed $r = 20m$.</p>
				<p>A turtle entering a roundabout randomly chooses it's exit according to the turtle's final direction.</p>
				<p>Possible routes of a car coming from the south are illustrated in <em>figure 2</em>. Please note the missing U-turn option.</p>
				<p>A car entering the roundabout yields the right of way when entering the roundabout at point <em>A</em>.</p>
				<p>The roundabout patches has higher priority than road patches with speed limited to $8 m/s = 28.8 km/h$.</p>
				<p>Maximum allowed speed of road patches outside the roundabout is limited to $14 m/s = 50.4 km/h$.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="one-third">
				<h3>Roundabout with quick right turn</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/roundabout-quick-right.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Roundabout with quick right turn</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Another modeled scheme is a <em>Roundabout with a quick right turn</em>. This is a variation of a Classic roundabout control scheme.</p>
				<p>In this model, a car with an intent of right turn does not enter roundabout at all. Instead, it uses separate road to decrease the load of the roundabout.</p>
				<p>Road metrics introduced in <em>Classic roundabout</em> also hold in this model. Radius of right turn $r_{outer}$ is 5 meters higher than roundabout radius $r_{inner}$.</p>
				<p>$r_{outer} = r_{inner} + 5 m = 25 m$</p>
			</div>

			<div class="one-third">
				<h3>Traffic lights</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/traffic-lights.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Fixed interval traffic lights</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>We have chosen <em>Traffic Lights</em> with fixed interval to be the last modeled scheme in this project.</p>
				<p>Car waits on point A in <em>figure 3</em> until there is a green light for its direction.</p>
				<p>Interval consists of green-light length and orange-light length.</p>
				<p>Our model suffers from deadlock of turtles under certain conditions (e.g. high traffic flow combined with long switch interval).</p>
				<p>In our model, green lights lasts for 40 seconds and orange light for 10 seconds.</p>
				<p>Lane gap is fixed on $g = 8$.</p>
				<p>Maximum allowed speed on all patches is $14 m/s = 50.4 km/h$.</p>

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			<p>For our simulations we have created 4 scenarios, each with its characteristic distribution of traffic flow across possible turtle origins.</p>
			<p>Simulations were executed under different load levels. Current load is adjustable using slider on the right.</p>
			<p>As the metric we use <strong>average time on road</strong> for currently existing turtles. Since one traffic flow from certain direction can have a significant impact on another flow, we count the average time for each direction separately.</p>

			<p>In the first scenario, traffic flow income is uniformly distributed across possible directions.</p>
			<p>At the lowest load (bound <strong>A</strong>) of about 40 new turtles per 100 ticks (or 24 turtles per minute), we see a clear advantage of roundabout design. Since <em>Traffic lights</em> are interval-based, turtles need wait even if other roads are empty.</p>
			<p>At 77 turtles per minute (bound <strong>B</strong>), <em>Classic Roundabout</em> looses its initial advantage. Turtles are required to yield-at-entry, which becomes ineffective due to the allocation factor included in this model.</p>
			<p>Limits of all intersection is found at the same bound of 86 turtles per minute (bound <strong>C</strong>) ticks. At this point, congestions are forming at all modeled intersections.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Design of intersections is one of the most important aspects of effective traffic control in both urban and rural areas.</p>

			<aside class="aside-right possible-extensions">
				<h3>Possible extensions</h3>
				<p>Even though traffic rules are complex and differ in some countries, they are mostly deterministic. Drivers, on the other hand, may act unpredictably and heterogenously under certain conditions.</p>
				<p>A possibility of traffic accidents has not been considered in our model. In the real world, slightly less effective control scheme may result in more robust system, prone to the accidents and other unpredictable situations.</p>
				<p>In the real world, control system may even be limited by the space. This might be the reason why in the dense urban environment with grid layout we see almost exclusively only traffic lights.</p>
				<p>Another possible extension is to include pedestrians into our model. According to the 1994 before-and-after study conducted in Netherlands<sup>4</sup>, roundabouts result in 89% less pedestrian injuries. In roundabouts, greater safety is achieved through artificial obstacle, i.e. central island, effectively lowering speed of the vehicles<sup>5</sup>.</p>
				<p>Other possible extensions include environmental impact, aesthetics and building costs.</p>
			</aside>

			<p>Years of research and experiments put roundabouts in favor of other traditional control mechanisms such as traffic lights.</p>
			<p>Not surprisingly we see a wide adoption of roundabouts in the recent years. Despite the initial doubt and distrust, roundabouts came into liking of the general public<sup>5</sup>.</p>
			<p>Roundabouts generally lead to a higher safety and increased efficiency, yet our simulation was not such clear in this aspect.</p>
			<p>Simple roundabout fared better than traffic lights in only 1 of 4 simulated scenarios. On the other hand, modified roundabout with quick right turn outperformed other schemes in all scenarios.</p>
			<p>Our findings cannot be considered convincing in declaring either traffic lights or roundabout to be superior in terms of efficiency than the other modeled scheme.</p>
			<p>Further evaluation is due, requiring more realistic environment discussed in the <em>Possible Extensions</em> section.</p>
			<p>Modeling under realistic conditions can quickly become extremely complex.</p>
			<p>We needed to simplify our model in such ways that diverge from the real world as little as possible while maintaning flexibility and performance of our models.</p>
			<p>Both more realistic environment and higher accuracy can be achieved through advanced or even specialized simulation software. Specialized software such as TransModeler<sup>6</sup> is being used in professional environment.</p>
			<p>During simulations, we have encountered many performance issues. These were amplified by the limitations of NetLogo development environment as well as its own scripting language.</p>
			<p>Simulations using advanced tools with higher computing power may find ways how to effectively scale traffic control designs under increased traffic flow. This is an important aspect when assessing and comparing different designs.</p>
			<p>Our models considered only one lane for each direction, while advantages of certain designs may appear only under higher load.</p>
