			<h1>Microsimulation and Traffic Flow Analysis at Roundabouts and Traffic Lights</h1>
			<p class="authors">Jakub Jurových, Peter Sandtner, Obligatory Asian Dude</p>
		</header>

		
		<section class="abstract">
			<p>We use a cellular automaton model to simulate 3 types of intersections - (1) simple roundabout, (2) roundabout with quick right turn and (3) basic traffic lights.</p>
			<p>We analyze the traffic flow dynamics of each intersections, finding bounds of their optimal use cases. We compare these traffic control systems in terms of their efficiency at usual traffic flow metrics such as <em>average time spent in the intersection</em> and <em>intersection throughput</em>.</p>
			<p>The model consists of 2 perpendicular roads each with 2 lanes (totaling 4 directions), intersection control system and homogenous agents representing cars.</p>
			<p>For this task we used NetLogo simulation software. Source code of our simulation is attached in the document.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p>During the past few decades we have seen a wide adoption of alternative traffic control schemes, especially roundabouts.</p>
				<p>Traffic managements is becoming extremely complex due to overloaded communications and predicting the traffic flow cannot be considered reliable.</p>
				<p>A need for flexibility has lead to innovative traffic control mechanisms.</p>
				<p>With many possibilities in organization of vehicular traffic, it is important to understand basic principles of the intersections.</p>
				<p>Despite the promising results of roundabout scheme, we still encounter mostly traffic lights, which are typical for dense urban areas.
				<p>We set out to explore a very limited amount of these two traffic control mechanisms in simplified conditions.</p>
				<p>Our focus is solely on efficieny, not considering additional problems such as environmental impact or general safety.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Traffic simulation can become highly complex, considering many factors such as acceleration, yield-of-way-rules and speed regulation.</p>
				<p>A general objective of keeping the traffic flow on a highest level possible might be misleading.</p>
				<p>Despite the symmetric nature of our targeted intersections, traffic flow from one direction can be effectively throttled by another road.</p>
				<p>We try to understand the traffic flow limits considering the 4 directions of the intersection connects.</p>

			<h2>Construction of the Model</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p>The simulated world consists of a grid of 120x120 patches. Each patch represents <strong>1 m^2</strong> in the real world.</p>
				<p>As a base for our computations, we consider the smallest discrete time interval (aka <em>tick</em>) to be <strong>1 second</strong> in the real world.</p>
				<p>Cars are represented using NetLogo's <em>turtles</em>. Each turtle moves n patches over 1 second, where n is it's current speed.</p>
				<p>Turtles are allowed to move only on <em>road</em> patches. Each <em>road</em> patch has a static variable <em>priority</em> used for determining the right-of-way rules.</p>
				<p>Turtles are created on one of 4 <em>spawn</em> patches, each representing the one 4 possible directions. Spawn patches can be considered as the input of the <em>outside world</em>.</p>
				<p>Spawns are operated independently, using probabilistic function for creating new turtles. In one tick, at the most only 1 turtle is created on 1 spawn.</p>
				<p>Probabilistic distribution ensures the random space and time gaps between 2 turtles coming from the same direction.</p>
				<p>Random space gaps generated by the probabilistic function represent the <strong>Poisson distrubution</strong> of space gaps found in the real world situations<sup>[1]</sup>. <span class="todo">TODO: really? check the source</span></p>

				<h3>Movement of the Turtles</h3>
				<p>The concept of turtle movement is based on a modified version of <em>Nagel–Schreckenberg model</em><sup>[citation needed]</sup>. In this model we are not considering the random decrease of speed of turtles.</p>
				<p>The outline of our movement model of the turtle can be represented in these steps, which occur on every tick $i$:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<span class="todo">Prerobit turtleset do druheho kroku, 1. a 4. by sa mali vykonavat spolocne.</span>
						<p><strong>Acceleration:</strong> Velocity $v_{t}$ of each turtle {t} in turtleset $T$ is increased by the acceleration $a = 1$. This represents the acceleration of $1 m/s^2$ in the real world. <span class="todo">porovnat s realnym svetom</span></p>
						<p>$v_{t}^{(i+1/2)} = v_{t}^{(i)} + a$</p>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<p><strong>Slowing down:</strong> The velocity of the turtle is limited by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>maximal speed $vmax_r$ of road $r$</li>
							<li>distance $d$ to the nearest obstacle (another turtle, field allocated by another turtle or stopping traffic light)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>$v_{t}^{(i+1)} = min\{v_{t}^{(i+1/2)}, d\}$</p>
						<p>At this point, each turtle allocates fields in front of it. Since the movement may result in various ways (on crossings), at most $v_{t}^{(i+1/2)}$ is allocated for each possible way. <span class="todo">Toto treba prerobit aby kazda turtle alokovala patche len v tej ceste, ktorou sa naozaj vyda</span></p>
						<p>This leads to the effective introduction of real-world traffic rules such as right of way, since this process is run for turtles in turtleset $T$ <span class="todo">ordery by...</span></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Speed variation:</strong> This step in the original NS model represents the random slowdown of certain turtles. This event is not considered in our model.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Each turtle is moved ahead according to its velocity, obtaining new position $x_{t}^{(i+1)}$.</p>
						<p>$x_{t}^{(i+1)} = move(x_{t}^{(i+1)}, v_{t}^{(i+1)})$</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Implications: uniform acceleration</p>
